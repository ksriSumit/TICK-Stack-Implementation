# Different Security Measures Implemented
1. HTTPS Security: TICK Stack by default run on http security. Implementing https security makes it more secure. I have implemented https security by self-generated using openssl. I have used RSA-2048 for encryption. The implementation of the https security is given above. Please look above for reference.
2. InfluxDB Security: As stated above, using username password in the wizard that appears when we click Getting Started is another level of security that I have implemented.
3.	Kapacitor Security: For kapacitor also, setting up username password in the wizard that appears when we click Getting Started is another level of security that I have implemented.
4.
